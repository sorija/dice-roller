# D&Dice
[View the app](https://d-n-dice.herokuapp.com/)\
A basic rpg dice roller; supports all standard polyhedral dice including percentile.

### Randomness
The app uses [RANDOM.ORG API](https://www.random.org/) to ensure *true* randomness for your nerdy pleasure.
> "The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in computer programs." [API's homepage]
